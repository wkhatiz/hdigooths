# HDIGOOTHS
A React Native application aiming to take the below map of Town Hall Station and recreate it as a weighted graph. From  there, dijktsras algorithm can be used to find the shortest path from any node in the graph. This React Native appliation displays all the exit nodes in the graph and allows you to pick one to begin recieving directions on how to get to it from your starting point.
